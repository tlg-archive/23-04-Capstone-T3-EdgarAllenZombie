You are 18 year old Edgar Allen and known to your friends as Edgar Allen 'Zombie'.
Due to your unique fascination with all things dark and grim, you enjoy searching
through abandoned buildings others deem haunted, just to get that feeling of excitement
and the tingle of unknown, but all good things come to an end when you always find the
open window or creaky floorboard that caused others to believe in ghosts.

Tonight you find yourself in another ordinary abandoned mansion, determined to enjoy
the thrill for as long as you can.  There's plenty of rooms in this one that could
hold untold mysteries. Why not enjoy it while it lasts.
